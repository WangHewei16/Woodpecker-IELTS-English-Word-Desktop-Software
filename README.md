It can also strengthen usersâ€™ memories of vocabulary by several functions such as **self-testing, vocabulary push, and adding unfamiliar words to the notebook**. Furthermore, the software is designed to motivate users to learn new words by its **clock-in** function.

Our software provides users with **two different testing methods**: word spelling detection and pronunciation recognition. First of all, an interesting game can test the user's word memorization. The user will complete the spelling of multiple words according to the game prompts. In addition, the user can also read the pronunciation of a given word, then let the software recognize and give a corresponding score.

In terms of memorizing words, the software will **automatically** select suitable words according to the target IELTS score set by the user, so as to avoid words that are too difficult or too simple to affect the user's mood of memorizing words. The user is also allowed to set the number of words to learn each day, and then this software can **record the user's learning situation** and give **feedback**, promoting the user's **self-reflection** and **English ability improvement**.
